# Photo Renamer
Photo manager application which allows users to go through their files and tag their images. The user can then search for images based on a set of tags, without opening up the application, through their own operating system. 

The GUI was built using Swing.

My professor for this project was Paul Gries and my partner was Ammar Akhtar.
