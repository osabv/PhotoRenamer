# Photo Renamer
PhotoRenamer is an application that allows a user to easily rename image files based on a set of tags. The user can choose a directory and view a list of all image files anywhere under that directory. When viewing an image, the user can select tags from the currently-existing tags, and the user can also add new tags and delete existing ones from the currently-existing ones. The user can then search for images based on a set of tags, without opening up the application, through their own operating system. 

The code for the program was written in Java and the GUI was built using Swing.

My professor for this project was Paul Gries. This project was built in collboration with Ammmar Akhtar.
